This project explores how pricing decisions impact revenue, customer churn, operational costs, and product value.  
Using a synthetic dataset, I created a complete pricing intelligence dashboard that visualizes the relationship between product tiers, revenue performance, churn behavior, issue patterns, and cost to serve.

The goal is to simulate how a PM and TPM can partner to build a pricing framework that improves margins while delivering fair and transparent customer value.

## Business Problem  
Many consumer facing financial products suffer from:

- misaligned pricing structures  
- rising cost to serve  
- unclear feature value  
- high churn among price sensitive segments  
- high refund and concession rates  
- poor visibility into unit economics  

These challenges limit revenue growth, create operational strain, and impact customer trust.

This project addresses the need for a **value aligned pricing strategy** supported by data, segmentation, and technical infrastructure.

---

## Objectives  
- Analyze revenue distribution across product tiers  
- Understand churn behavior and its pricing implications  
- Compare price against cost to serve to identify margin leakage  
- Explore customer issue types to understand perception gaps  
- Evaluate regional revenue variation for localization  
- Build a dashboard that connects pricing, revenue, and customer value  

---

## Key Insights  
- Higher tier customers (Advanced and Enterprise) drive the majority of revenue  
- Essential tier customers show the highest churn and lowest satisfaction  
- The Essential product operates near or below cost, indicating underpricing  
- Refund and value mismatch issues are concentrated in lower tiers  
- Revenue is geographically stable with opportunities for regional pricing strategy  
- Churn risk decreases as perceived value and price alignment increase  

---

## Dashboard Visualizations  
The dashboard includes:

- Total Revenue  
- Average Churn Risk  
- Average Cost to Serve  
- Profit Margin  
- Revenue by Product Tier  
- Churn Risk by Product  
- Region Wise Revenue  
- Issue Type Breakdown (Heatmap)  
- Revenue Trend Over Time  

---

## Data  
The dataset is a 5000 row synthetic dataset created to simulate realistic pricing scenarios in a consumer financial product context.  
Fields include:

- Product tier  
- Revenue  
- Price  
- Cost to serve  
- Churn risk  
- Region  
- Channel  
- Issue type  
- Event timestamp  

Dataset is included in the repository.

## Technical Approach (TPM View)

### Architecture Considerations  
A scalable pricing system would require:

- A pricing rules engine  
- Usage and behavior based pricing inputs  
- Entitlement service for feature gating  
- Billing logic integration  
- A B testing framework for pricing experiments  
- Monitoring and observability for price impacts  

### Metrics Required  
- ARPU  
- NRR  
- Refund rate  
- Tier upgrade rate  
- Attach rate for add ons  
- Segment level profitability  
- Cost to serve

## PM Strategy Impact  
This analysis supports:

- Value aligned pricing  
- Tier migration strategy  
- Add on monetization  
- Churn reduction  
- Regional pricing opportunities  
- Improved unit economics  
- Better communication of product value  

---

## Future Enhancements  
- Dynamic pricing simulation  
- Cost to serve forecasting  
- Machine learning model for churn prediction  
- Automated pricing experiments  
- Real time revenue monitoring

## About Me  
I am a strategic problem solver with experience in analytics and program management.  
My work focuses on business strategy, data driven decision making, and designing scalable systems that drive product value.
If my work aligns with the needs of your team, I would welcome a conversation.

This project is a part of my 30 day Applied Business Strategy Challenge where I solve one business problem each day as a TPM with analytical mindset.
